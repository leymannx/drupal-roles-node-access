Drupal Restrict Node Access depending on Node ID and Role
========================

A very simple Drupal module to restrict access to certain nodes based on node IDs (nid) and user roles. If a user comes to a selected node and is not of a defined allowed role s/he won't be able to access it, instead will see default "Access Denied" text.

1. download, unzip, customize (set roles and nids)
2. enable
3. enjoy
